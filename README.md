# Decision Tree
Data Structure project
One of the most widely used data mining algorithms is the decision tree algorithm. When the tree is used for classification tasks, it is known as a classification tree, and when it is used for regression activities, it is called a regression decision tree. In this tree, we form the tree using Train data and then predict the data output with Test data. Basically, the decision tree works as a function. Train data includes two parts: attributes and output (labels). Test data only includes features.
